# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-28
Feature: Candidate Profiler - Full Implementation

## Codebase Patterns
- Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin (no separate config file)
- Custom colors: sidebar, accent, surface defined in @theme block in index.css
- Custom fonts: font-heading (DM Sans), font-body (IBM Plex Sans)
- Component classes: .nav-link, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary defined in @layer components

## 2026-01-28 - T01: Project Setup
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c064f-244a-70f8-9788-46f4abee2faf
Task ID: T01
- Initialized Vite + React 19 + TypeScript project
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/forms plugin via @tailwindcss/vite
- Installed dependencies: dexie, react-router-dom, date-fns, uuid
- Created folder structure: src/{components,pages,db,utils,types,hooks}
- Set up React Router with routes: /, /candidates, /candidates/:id, /profiles, /settings
- Created Layout with dark sidebar (#0f172a) and refined editorial aesthetic
- Created skeleton pages: CandidateList, CandidateDetail, ProfileManager, Settings
- Defined TypeScript types in src/types/index.ts
- Created AGENTS.md with project conventions

**Files created:**
- package.json, vite.config.ts, index.html
- src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/index.css
- src/components/Layout.tsx, src/components/Sidebar.tsx
- src/pages/CandidateList.tsx, CandidateDetail.tsx, ProfileManager.tsx, Settings.tsx
- src/types/index.ts
- AGENTS.md

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes
- Dev server runs at http://localhost:5173
- Navigation between all routes works (verified via agent-browser)

## 2026-01-28 - T02: IndexedDB Schema & Data Layer
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c0653-b579-72fc-aeaf-e1bd04e5f190
Task ID: T02
- Set up Dexie database in src/db/index.ts with stores: candidates, interviews, profiles, settings
- Created CRUD hooks in src/db/hooks.ts: useProfiles, useCandidates, useInterviews (with all CRUD operations)
- Implemented default profile seeding (Builder, Specialist, Leader, Generalist, Learner)
- Added DatabaseProvider component for initialization and error handling
- Installed dexie-react-hooks for reactive queries

**Files created:**
- src/db/index.ts - Dexie database setup with schema
- src/db/hooks.ts - React hooks for CRUD operations using useLiveQuery
- src/db/seed.ts - Default profile seeding logic
- src/db/DatabaseProvider.tsx - Initialization and error boundary

**Files modified:**
- src/App.tsx - Wrapped with DatabaseProvider
- package.json - Added dexie-react-hooks dependency

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Use useLiveQuery from dexie-react-hooks for reactive queries
- All mutations are async functions (not hooks) for easy calling from event handlers
- Transactions used for cascading operations (delete candidate with interviews)
- deleteInterview prevents deletion of last interview (FR-2 requirement)

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes

## 2026-01-28 - T03: Profile Manager UI
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c0655-4434-74f4-ae2b-57ad391b48cf
Task ID: T03
- Implemented full Profile Manager page with list, create/edit modal, and delete confirmation
- Created reusable ProfileModal component with form validation
- Created reusable ConfirmDialog component for delete confirmations
- Added "in use" warning when deleting profiles assigned to candidates/interviews
- Added CSS animations for modal enter/exit (fade-in, zoom-in-95)

**Files created:**
- src/components/ProfileModal.tsx - Create/Edit modal with form
- src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx - Reusable confirmation dialog

**Files modified:**
- src/pages/ProfileManager.tsx - Full implementation with table, CRUD operations
- src/index.css - Added animation utilities and line-clamp

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
- Edit/delete buttons hidden by default, shown on row hover (opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100)
- Modal/dialog pattern: fixed overlay with backdrop blur + centered content
- Async isProfileInUse check before showing delete dialog to display warning

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes
- Profile list displays seeded profiles correctly
- Create Profile modal opens and creates new profiles
- Edit Profile modal opens with pre-filled data
- Delete confirmation dialog shows warning when profile is in use
- All tested via agent-browser

## 2026-01-28 - T04: Candidate CRUD
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c0658-7aa6-72d4-8878-311e6fee654b
Task ID: T04
- Implemented full CandidateList page with table showing name, tags, interview count, hire signal
- Created CandidateModal component for create/edit (name + comma-separated tags)
- Create candidate redirects to detail page after creation
- Edit candidate modal pre-fills existing data
- Delete candidate shows confirmation dialog with cascade warning
- Reused ConfirmDialog component from T03

**Files created:**
- src/components/CandidateModal.tsx - Create/Edit modal with name and tags input

**Files modified:**
- src/pages/CandidateList.tsx - Full implementation with table, CRUD, empty state

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Tags input: comma-separated string, split and trim on save
- Row click navigates to detail, edit/delete buttons use e.stopPropagation()
- InterviewCountBadge uses useInterviews(candidateId) for reactive count
- HireSignalBadge uses Record<HireSignal, string> for color mapping

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes
- Empty state with "Add Candidate" button displays correctly
- Create Candidate modal opens and creates new candidate
- Candidate appears in table with tags, redirects to detail page
- Edit Candidate modal opens with pre-filled data
- Delete confirmation dialog shows cascade warning
- All tested via agent-browser

## 2026-01-28 - T05: Interview CRUD
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c065b-7923-705e-a79d-2840e07ad4af
Task ID: T05
- Created InterviewModal component with core fields (interviewer_name, interview_date, interview_type, notes_raw, hire_signal)
- Updated CandidateDetail page with full interview timeline list and CRUD operations
- Interview list shows interviewer name, type badge, hire signal badge, date, and notes preview

- src/pages/CandidateDetail.tsx - Full implementation with interview timeline, CRUD, loading/not-found states

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Interview modal uses default axis_scores (all 3s) and empty axis_notes for new interviews
- Delete interview uses deleteInterview hook which throws error if last interview
- ConfirmDialog warning prop shows "cannot delete" message for last interview
- InterviewTypeBadge uses same pattern as HireSignalBadge (Record<Type, string> for styles)
- Loading state: animate-pulse skeleton placeholders
- Not-found state: centered message with "Back to Candidates" button

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes
- CandidateDetail shows "No interviews yet" empty state

- Interview appears in timeline after creation with all badges
- Edit Interview modal pre-fills existing data
- Delete shows warning when trying to delete last interview

## 2026-01-28 - T06: Candidate List View
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c065f-3cae-7209-b5a9-a89b18549667
Task ID: T06

- Added "No matching candidates" empty state when filters return no results
- Added "Clear all" button to reset filters

**Files modified:**
- src/pages/CandidateList.tsx - Added search, tag filters, sorting, profile column, updated column

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Use useMemo for derived state (profileMap lookup, filteredCandidates, allTags)
- Profile display: build Map<id, name> from useProfiles(), then lookup in render
- Filter state: searchQuery string + selectedTags array, combine with AND logic
- Sort state: sortField + sortDirection, toggle direction if same field clicked
- Tag filter chips: selected = accent bg with X icon, unselected = slate bg
- SortIcon component shows asc/desc chevrons with accent color when active

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes

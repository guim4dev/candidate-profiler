# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-28
Feature: Candidate Profiler - Full Implementation

## Codebase Patterns
- Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin (no separate config file)
- Custom colors: sidebar, accent, surface defined in @theme block in index.css
- Custom fonts: font-heading (DM Sans), font-body (IBM Plex Sans)
- Component classes: .nav-link, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary defined in @layer components

## 2026-01-28 - T01: Project Setup
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c064f-244a-70f8-9788-46f4abee2faf
Task ID: T01
- Initialized Vite + React 19 + TypeScript project
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/forms plugin via @tailwindcss/vite
- Installed dependencies: dexie, react-router-dom, date-fns, uuid
- Created folder structure: src/{components,pages,db,utils,types,hooks}
- Set up React Router with routes: /, /candidates, /candidates/:id, /profiles, /settings
- Created Layout with dark sidebar (#0f172a) and refined editorial aesthetic
- Created skeleton pages: CandidateList, CandidateDetail, ProfileManager, Settings
- Defined TypeScript types in src/types/index.ts
- Created AGENTS.md with project conventions

**Files created:**
- package.json, vite.config.ts, index.html
- src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/index.css
- src/components/Layout.tsx, src/components/Sidebar.tsx
- src/pages/CandidateList.tsx, CandidateDetail.tsx, ProfileManager.tsx, Settings.tsx
- src/types/index.ts
- AGENTS.md

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes
- Dev server runs at http://localhost:5173
- Navigation between all routes works (verified via agent-browser)

## 2026-01-28 - T02: IndexedDB Schema & Data Layer
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c0653-b579-72fc-aeaf-e1bd04e5f190
Task ID: T02
- Set up Dexie database in src/db/index.ts with stores: candidates, interviews, profiles, settings
- Created CRUD hooks in src/db/hooks.ts: useProfiles, useCandidates, useInterviews (with all CRUD operations)
- Implemented default profile seeding (Builder, Specialist, Leader, Generalist, Learner)
- Added DatabaseProvider component for initialization and error handling
- Installed dexie-react-hooks for reactive queries

**Files created:**
- src/db/index.ts - Dexie database setup with schema
- src/db/hooks.ts - React hooks for CRUD operations using useLiveQuery
- src/db/seed.ts - Default profile seeding logic
- src/db/DatabaseProvider.tsx - Initialization and error boundary

**Files modified:**
- src/App.tsx - Wrapped with DatabaseProvider
- package.json - Added dexie-react-hooks dependency

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Use useLiveQuery from dexie-react-hooks for reactive queries
- All mutations are async functions (not hooks) for easy calling from event handlers
- Transactions used for cascading operations (delete candidate with interviews)
- deleteInterview prevents deletion of last interview (FR-2 requirement)

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes

## 2026-01-28 - T03: Profile Manager UI
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c0655-4434-74f4-ae2b-57ad391b48cf
Task ID: T03
- Implemented full Profile Manager page with list, create/edit modal, and delete confirmation
- Created reusable ProfileModal component with form validation
- Created reusable ConfirmDialog component for delete confirmations
- Added "in use" warning when deleting profiles assigned to candidates/interviews
- Added CSS animations for modal enter/exit (fade-in, zoom-in-95)

**Files created:**
- src/components/ProfileModal.tsx - Create/Edit modal with form
- src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx - Reusable confirmation dialog

**Files modified:**
- src/pages/ProfileManager.tsx - Full implementation with table, CRUD operations
- src/index.css - Added animation utilities and line-clamp

**Codebase patterns learned:**
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
- Edit/delete buttons hidden by default, shown on row hover (opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100)
- Modal/dialog pattern: fixed overlay with backdrop blur + centered content
- Async isProfileInUse check before showing delete dialog to display warning

**Verified:**
- npm run typecheck passes
- Profile list displays seeded profiles correctly
- Create Profile modal opens and creates new profiles
- Edit Profile modal opens with pre-filled data
- Delete confirmation dialog shows warning when profile is in use
- All tested via agent-browser
